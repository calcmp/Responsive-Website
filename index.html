            located on a beautiful campus in the North West of England, the
            University places great emphasis on a strong student experience and
            employability and gives students access to academics who are experts
            in their field. Lancaster is one of only a handful of universities
            with a collegiate system which has helped to forge a strong sense of
            identity and loyalty, and continues to be a distinctive feature of
            student life at Lancaster. Students from one hundred countries make
            up a thriving community based around our nine colleges, creating a
            culturally diverse campus in a location that boasts the combination
            of city, coast and countryside.
